# fast-EADAM
A solver for college admission problem with consent based on paper 'Legal Assignments and fast EADAM with consent via classical theory of stable matchings'.

Warning: It is still in construction. The correctness and efficiency are not guaranteed.

## Current Progress
Build the basic data structure; Implement Gale-Shapley Algorithm in O(E) time and space complexity. 

## TODO
Add some comments; Implement fast EADAM.
